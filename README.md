PDF-to-Speech
=============

I developed this android application as my mini project for Department of Computing &amp; Information Systems in Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka.  The prime objective of “PDF to Speech” is to create a full-fledged Android application which can convert PDF in to speech. By using this application users can listen to PDF documents while they drive, run, or walk the dog. Before user plays the PDF document, he/she need to select one from his/her device storage (SD card or internal memory) by using file explorer. Then user can play and listen to it as media player. For that system extract text from the PDF and convert in to speech by using speech engine.
